# detect-anomalies
Details of the data set: data set contains real-time current readings of a 3-phase AC motor (3.2hp) motor current signature analysis and model-based VI analysis to be done to detect anomalies Write an ML model to detect anomalies in this data set.
The model should learn, and predict future anomalies and link on the data set below check it https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d70I-XacHhA7i7MsVQa-iFJvp2nTiayA 
I'll train a data set and run code checks.Â
